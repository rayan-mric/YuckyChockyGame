Yucky Chocky 🍫🧼

Welcome to Yucky Chocky, a simple but strategic chocolate-eating puzzle game.
Don’t let the delicious look fool you — one piece of this bar is not chocolate…
It’s soap. And whoever eats the soap loses!

🎮 Game Concept

The game begins with a rectangular chocolate bar made of smaller square pieces.
Players take turns breaking the chocolate either:

Horizontally, or

Vertically

In this version, a player can break the chocolate only from the top or the left side of the bar.

When you break the bar, you "eat" (remove) the chosen portion. The bar becomes smaller and smaller after each move.

But here’s the twist:

👉 The bottom-right corner piece is NOT chocolate — it’s a soap slice.
👉 Whoever is forced to eat that final slice loses the game.

So the goal is simple:

✔ Eat chocolate
✘ Avoid soap
✔ Force your opponent to take the last (soapy) piece

🧠 Strategy Tip

Think ahead!
Every cut changes the shape of the chocolate.
Try to leave your opponent with no choice but to take the final slice.

🚀 How to Play

Start with a chocolate bar grid.

On your turn, choose:

Break from top (horizontal cut), or

Break from left (vertical cut)

The selected portion is removed (eaten).

The player who ends up eating the last bottom-right piece (soap) loses.

😄 Have Fun!

Happy gaming — and remember:
Hope you won’t eat the last slice… I mean, the soap!
